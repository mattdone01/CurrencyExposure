	The concepts in this article are simple but amazingly misunderstood by most participants in currency markets because FX providers are reticent to explain in it any great detail how they make money from their clients.&nbsp; Have you ever wondered why your bank or FX provider more often than do not display their rates on their website?&nbsp; The aim of this article is to explain how market rates are calculated and passed on.
</p>
<p>
	The basis of the spot market is the interbank rate or in any other words the wholesale rate that banks are able to deal between each other.&nbsp; This rate is shown live through electronic broking platforms such Reuters and it also shows the forward market rates.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
	These are broken down in to the &lsquo;bid&rsquo; and &lsquo;offer&rsquo; rates.&nbsp; This indicates which side of the market you are on and is termed by bankers and brokers left hand side (bid) or right hand side (offer).&nbsp; If you are an importer you will be on the left and an exporter on the right.&nbsp; A typical rate for AUD/USD might be 1.4560/1.4563 and this gives you an idea of the market &lsquo;spread&rsquo;.&nbsp; &nbsp;Websites such as Oanda.com display fairly accurate interbank rates and others such as XE.com will give you the mid market rate or the middle of the bid and the offer.
</p>
<p>
	Banks and FX providers buy and sell at these rates and then pass this on their customer with a &lsquo;margin&rsquo;.&nbsp; Therefore working out this margin or the dollar value they made off each transaction is:
</p>
<p>
	Dealer margin &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Interbank rate (spot) &ndash; your rate
</p>
<p>
	$ Value &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dealer margin x Interbank rate (spot)
</p>
<p>
	How is this margin rate determined for each customer?
</p>
<p>
	This is where it becomes interesting &ndash; there is no hard and fast rule to determine what rate is &lsquo;your rate&rsquo;. &nbsp;However from our experience in the market, the primary variable is your willingness and ability to negotiate.
</p>
<p>
	One of the best tools to negotiate is by shopping around. &nbsp;With so many providers on the market, simply by letting your provider you have set up an account with another provider will be enough for them to reduce their rates some time very significantly to ensure they ward of the competitor.&nbsp; Time after time as an FX salesperson, I have seen the margins we charge a client been wiped out by them been approached by another competitor.
</p>
<p>
	Obviously the more volume you are doing the more leverage you have.&nbsp; If you are just doing a spot transaction then there is less ways to hide margin in the rate i.e. forward or options products.&nbsp; Exotic currencies such as some South East Asian, African, Pacific Island or South American currencies are all harder to source off shore and tend to have a higher margin.
</p>
<p>
	In summary, if you are just entering the world of trading in foreign exchange or if your business has been dealing with the same provider for many years, we implore you to do your research as there are significant savings for your business by keeping your provider honest.
