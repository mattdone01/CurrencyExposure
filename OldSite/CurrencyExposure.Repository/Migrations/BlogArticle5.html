	The team here at&nbsp;<a href="http://currencyexposure.com/" target="_blank">CurrencyExposure.com</a>&nbsp;are not adverse to the use of currency options in a hedging strategy.&nbsp;&nbsp;Options can be used effectively in conjunction with other products when taking a portfolio approach to hedge.&nbsp;&nbsp;However we are a cynical bunch over here and recommend that buyers beware - options are pushed hard by most FX providers because of the money they can make.
</p>
<p>
	There are an absolute plethora of FX or currency options available but all options are just structured by two kinds the put and a call.&nbsp;&nbsp;Creative dealers spend time coming up with different combinations and then packaging them up and selling them to their clients.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some will look better under different market conditions where there is more or less volatility or different tenors but when it comes down to it, the dealers are just trying to sell a product to you and it is worth understanding a bit more of how they are priced.
</p>
<p>
	A vanilla option will be either a call or put, can be priced using one of the wholesale banks options pricing modules.&nbsp;&nbsp;The put (sell) or call (buy) options will have a premium attached worked out as a calculation of the face value amount.&nbsp;&nbsp;But when you package the two up, they will net off against each other meaning there is no premium attached.&nbsp;&nbsp;The dealer will offer a zero cost product however the price is calculated within the rates that they give you.
</p>
<p>
	I will try and illustrate with a very common zero cost option called a &lsquo;collar&rsquo;.&nbsp;&nbsp;This allows you to be capped and protected within a range &ndash; for example 6 months time to buy USD against the AUD.&nbsp;
</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" style="width: 250px;">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>
				<span>Current Spot &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></td>
			<td>
				<span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">1.000 (</span><span>AUD/USD)</span></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
				<span>Current FEC rate &nbsp;</span></td>
			<td>
				<span>0.9800</span></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
				<span>Capped &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></td>
			<td>
				<span>0.9900</span></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
				<span>Protected</span></td>
			<td>
				<span>0.9600</span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
<p>
	In this instance you have participation of 1 cent or 100 points above the FEC rate and 2 cents or 200points below and therefore it is essentially asymmetric meaning you are giving up more than you get.&nbsp;&nbsp;If there was no FX margin in this deal then it would likely give you equal upside and downside.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
	Dealers will hide their margin in to these products because there is no way to compare unless you have two dealers on the line structuring up the same product.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even then there are various inputs that mean they end up with different prices.
</p>
<div>
	It is also very important to use the forward rate to compare these products. &nbsp;Whenever you receive some pricing from an FX provider ensure that they disclose what the forward rate would be for the same period. This will allow you to understand if it really makes sense because experience tells us, you are getting something on one hand but haven&#39;t something taken away on the other. &nbsp;That is the nature of these products. &nbsp;It also helps you to have a feeling of where you think the market might be heading because essentially by entering in to one of these products, you do have a &#39;view&#39;.
