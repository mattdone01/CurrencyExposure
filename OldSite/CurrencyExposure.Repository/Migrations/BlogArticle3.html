	Forward Exchange Contracts (FEC) are by far the most commonly used instrument to hedge currency exposure globally.&nbsp; According to the Bank of International Settlements, 44% of daily FX turnover is made up from FEC&rsquo;s, versus spot 37%.
</p>
<p>
	The reason why they are so commonly used is because they are simple to understand and whilst they are a &ldquo;contract&rdquo; as such, they are also quite flexible &ndash; you can pre-deliver or draw down on forwards as and when you need to use them and some institutions will also allow you to &ldquo;roll&rdquo; or extend them for certain periods.
</p>
<p>
	There are different kinds of FEC&rsquo;s in the market but the most commonly used in Australia allows the user to pre-deliver and to have the rate adjusted.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the most common in Commonwealth countries such as Australia and the UK but in the US for example, the convention is called a &lsquo;window forward&rsquo; which as the name suggests allows you to deliver the forward within a set time frame e.g. 15 days either side of the expiry.&nbsp;&nbsp; In this case, the rate is not readjusted.
</p>
<p>
	If the forward points are negative then the base currency is said to be at a premium (the forward price is higher than the spot price).&nbsp; If it is negative is said to be at a &ldquo;forward discount&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>
	For example if you are hedging the AUD against the USD (buying USD and selling AUD), the forward points will be at a discount and the forward rate will be less than the spot rate.&nbsp; Vice versa, if you are hedging USD receipts from sales (or exports) then the forward points will be less than the spot rate and therefore work in your favour.&nbsp; This is important to understand because it is another way FX providers can take advantage of their clients and make more margin on the more unsophisticated.

	For any CFO or treasurer, it is worth having an understanding of how forward (FWD) points are calculated, as it is actually a pretty simple calculation.&nbsp; FX providers will a lot of the time add extra points in to their margin when quoting on FWDs because they know a lot of people will not know the exact amount &ndash; a tried and tested way of making more money from you.

	<strong>Advantages:</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Forwards are used so commonly because they do not have an upfront cost, they have a certain amount of flexibility and they protect you 100% if the market were to move against you.&nbsp; They lock in profit margins, they are easy to understand an easy to account for.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Disadvantages:</strong>
</p>
<p>
	They are a &lsquo;contract&rsquo; meaning your business is obligated to deal at that contract rate if the market moves with you or in your favour.&nbsp; This means that you may be locked in to dealing at a rate that is disadvantageous.
</p>
<p>
	In addition to this some FX providers have margin call clauses for providing you with credit and it is very important that you are fully aware of the implications of these credit terms.

	In further articles we will be explaining the calculations for working out forward points.&nbsp; We are also working on a hedging tool that will allow you to check forward points against what you have been quoted by your provider.
