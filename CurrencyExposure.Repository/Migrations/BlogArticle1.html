	Welcome to the new blog of CurrencyExposure.com! &nbsp;
</div>
<div>
	We started this blog because we have sold foreign currency solutions to the SME and Corporate segment in Australia and have a very good understanding of the problems that businesses have in managing their foreign currency exposure.&nbsp;
</div>

	We also know the way that FX providers make money off their clients. &nbsp;I have ripped off my share of clients over the years&hellip;Yes I hate to admit it but these are the <strong>confessions of an FX salesman. &nbsp;</strong>
</div>
<div>
	The industry as a whole will take advantage wherever possible of unsophisticated small and medium sized businesses. &nbsp;To give you an example, I once came across one of the big four Australian banks that was taking a 16% margin on a small Australian charity &ndash; that is,<strong> a bank making 16 cents off every dollar donated to that charity, that was been transferred &nbsp;to a third world country for humanitarian aid!&nbsp;</strong>
</div>

</div>
<div>
	The reason that these banks can do this is that the FX market works as an &lsquo;over the counter&rsquo; or OTC market i.e. is unlike the equities industry which is a &lsquo;security traded&rsquo; industry. &nbsp;Banks and FX providers buy and sell on the wholesale market (called the interbank rate) and then pass on their own rates on FX products and add a margin depending on what they believe they can charge their customers.

	We decided to begin this blog because we found there is no independent community or resource for businesses that are exposed to currency markets and we want to build a knowledge base for people to refer to about foreign currency products, providers and market trends.
</div>
<div>
	We are also working on some tools to help businesses take the guess work out of hedging decisions because we know first-hand the impact these decisions have on businesses both positive and negative.
