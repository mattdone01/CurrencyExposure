	For many CFO&rsquo;s a corporate hedging policy is not existent and decisions about when to hedge and how much are loosely proscribed.
</p>
<p>
	However, having a formal and objective policy that is signed off by a board of Director&rsquo;s can be very advantageous when questions are asked about FX losses!&nbsp; The aim of this series of articles is to illustrate some commonly used hedging policies and the advantages of implementing.
</p>
<p>
	Developing a hedging policy or strategy can be time consuming and problematic &ndash; there is no size fits all approach to this but there are a number of basic policies that make a lot of sense and can be easy to follow.
</p>
<p>
	In our experience one that is very common in the Australian market place is what we will call the &lsquo;rate driven&rsquo; approach.&nbsp; It can be used as a guideline or followed to the letter and therefore provides quite a bit of flexibility.
</p>
<p>
	It makes the distinction between &lsquo;chasing&rsquo; favourable rates (which is never a recommendation) and ensuring that when the market is trading within a range, the company is appropriately hedged.&nbsp; When the base currency is at historic lows, the company has no hedging in place allowing for currency appreciation and when it is at historic highs, it is 100% hedged and therefore protecting it from potential currency depreciation.
</p>
<p>
	To use an example, an Australian importer has an exposure to the USD.&nbsp; &nbsp;The long-term average of this currency pair is approximately is 75 cents.&nbsp; The company pays 1m on average per month in USD.&nbsp; They put in place the following policy and on a weekly or fortnightly, calculate their known exposure and put in place hedging for the appropriate market level.

	This type of policy takes all the subjectivity out of decision making but also allows for a certain amount of flexibility is desired.&nbsp; It also can be calculated easily by more junior team members and administratively is quite simple to implement.

	In future articles we will evaluate other hedging policies and factors you may want to consider in developing a hedging policy for your business.
